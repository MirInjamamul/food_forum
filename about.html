                  <p class="ct-u-size22 ct-u-fontWeight300 marginTop40">Food is at the heart of many of the world’s environmental, social and economic challenges. The issues – from soil health to public health – are complex and cannot be solved in isolation. As it stands, the way we produce and consume food is pushing the planet and its systems to the limit.
                    So how do we ensure enough safe, nutritious food for everyone, and food that’s produced sustainably and affordably? We call this sustainable nutrition - an approach that optimises health and nutritional outcomes whilst restoring the key ecosystems and farming livelihoods on which we depend.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To ensure that sustainable diets are the norm with more fruit, veg and plant-based proteins
                    </li> <li>To radically reduce food waste across the system
                    </li>	<li>To fast track the ability of the food industry to deliver sustainable nutrition outcomes
                    </li>	<li>To make regenerative, resilient agriculture the mainstream
                    </li>	</ul>
                  <p class="ct-u-size22 ct-u-fontWeight300 marginTop40">  ndeed the dislike for food packaging is not all baseless. There is a lot of bad and wasteful packaging out there. But any assessment of its impact on the environment must take into account the benefits one can derive from packaging in the shape of reduced food waste that can be realized by protecting and dispensing food properly. For instance, two percent of the milk produced in the US goes bad on supermarket shelves before it can be purchased. This dairy waste can be avoided with packaging technology such as Tetra Pak that saves milk from spoiling, even without refrigeration. However, environmentally aware consumers tend to dislike Tetra Pak material because they think it cannot be recycled. The truth, however, is that it can be recycled, but the process is rather complicated. 
                    
                    With almost every country in the world dealing with some form of malnutrition, and food production being the single most important driver of climate change and environmental damage, the world needs to find a way to feed its growing population with a sustainable, healthy diet. In the Middle East and North Africa (the MENA region) this challenge is particularly complex.
